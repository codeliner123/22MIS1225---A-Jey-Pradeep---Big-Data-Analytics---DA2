# Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Implementation

## About the Dataset
- The dataset is stored in 'dataset.csv' with 100 data points, each having 2 features.
- These data points are randomly generated to demonstrate the clustering capability of the SOM.

## How to Execute

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, minisom
- Install the libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn minisom
  ```

### How to Run
1. Ensure 'dataset.csv' and 'executable_code.py' are in the same directory.
2. Execute the code using the command:
   ```bash
   python executable_code.py
   ```

### Output
- The SOM visualization will be displayed, illustrating how the data points are clustered.

## Hardware Requirements
- A standard computer with at least 2GB RAM.

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x and the mentioned libraries installed.
